## [Why You Should Learn Git Even If You Don't Program (Yet)](/posts/why-you-should-learn-git.html)

Git is an amazing tool for facilitating collaboration. Because of it's early origin as the version control mechanism for managing the linux kernel, it's most often associated with large computer programming projects but few people outside (and probably inside) the software development community realize its versatility and applicability in other areas. 

But that's slowly changing. For example, recently ruffly 20 mathematics professors put together [a textbook](http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) on 'Homotopy Type Theory' using git in combination with an online tool called [Github](https://github.com/HoTT/book). Git was the glue that made this possible. Passing around word documents, images, and equations might have worked for a team of two but with more collaborates, the communication channels quickly grow. You can even watch a video of the teams collaboration in [this video](http://vimeo.com/68761218).

Back in April of 2012, Twitter also put their employee patent agreement, the [Innovator's Patent Agreement](https://blog.twitter.com/2012/introducing-innovators-patent-agreement), on Github with...

[Some people](https://github.com/maxogden) have event started using git with Github to version control their [cooking recipes](https://github.com/maxogden/recipes/blob/master/soup/chicken.md)

The really amazing thing about all of this is that if you or I feel inclined, we can easily contribute to these works via what's called `forking` followed by a `pull request`. `Forking` allows you to have your very own version of these documents that you can edit and change in anyway you like. A `pull request` allows you to recommend your changes back to the original authors essentially saying "hey! how about you accept this change I made back into your version of the project?"

This blog is even version controlled with git. [Fork it and fix my typos!](https://github.com/vicapow/vicapow.github.io)

To learn more about how to use git from the command line, you can checkout Github's excellent tutorial at [try.github.io](http://try.github.io/) or in most cases, you can get by just using Github's web interface.

Happy gitting!
