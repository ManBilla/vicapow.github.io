## [Simpsons Paradox Visualized in D3](/posts/simpsons-paradox.html)
July 24, 2013

> In probability and statistics, Simpson's paradox, or the Yule-Simpson effect, is a paradox in which a trend that appears in different groups of data disappears when these groups are combined, and the reverse trend appears for the aggregate data. This result is often encountered in social-science and medical-science statistics, and is particularly confounding when frequency data are unduly given causal interpretations. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox)
